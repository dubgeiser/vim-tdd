INTRODUCTION                                                             *tdd*

The basis for Vim's compile/eval system is |make|.  It runs some task(s) and
puts the results in the quickfix window.  By default, Vim uses the command
line tool 'make' as its build tool, but by using |compiler| you can switch
this, and the associated error messages.
There are a lot of built-in compilers and you can roll your own, which is what
this plugin does; it configures Vim's build system to run tests and report the
results back to the |quickfix| window.


USAGE                                                              *tdd-usage*

Execute |:RunTest| to run the current test, if all goes well, a green bar is
shown.  If one or more tests fail, a red bar is shown, together with a list of
failures and/or errors.

The current test can be whatever; one test method, a unit test, a whole test
suite, etc... The current test can be set with |:SetTest| whenever |:RunTest|
is executed, it will run the test that has been set last with |:SetTest|

tdd comes with some predefined settings for running tests, mainly to support
PHPUnit and PyUnit.
